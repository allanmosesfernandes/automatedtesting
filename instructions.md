Right here is what I want to build: I want to build a website that runs automated tests for the login flow of our application since we deploy across multiple regions. So everytime we deploy a new feature currently we are manually testing the auth flow. This is not efficient, I have written working tests already that live in the tests folder that I've picked from the testing I had done before. What I want now, is just a plain site like a frontend that our internal team comes to, put like a simple authentication, could even just be a HTTP auth stuff with username and password and I want them to have a button where they just click it and it runs the testing across all the regions. Bear in mind the tests currently test only qa but I think we can do it across live as well which is just a case of replacing the qa with www.
And at the end we just want in the same or new tab the results of the tests, and say while the tests are running we can have interesting trivia messages. Or maybe just a loading spinner.We already have a working set of tests so we don't need to spend time writting tests however use the playwright MCP to come up with improvements. and also the UI-design-specialist agent
